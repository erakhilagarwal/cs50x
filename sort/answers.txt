sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Performs well for sorted files compared to random and reversed files as compared to sort3. Complexity like O(n^2) and Omega(n)

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: fastest algorithm for all files compared to others. Complexity like O(n log(n)) and Omega(n log(n))

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Performs statically as per complexity of O(n^2) and Omega(n^2) for all cases.
